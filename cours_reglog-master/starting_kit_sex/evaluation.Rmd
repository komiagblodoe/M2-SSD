[1] Go on the challenge page, in the `Learn the details` tab, in the `get_starting_kit` item and download the starting kit by clicking the `Starting Kit` button.

[2] On your local machine, unzip the just downloaded zip file `stating_kit_sex.zip` and open *R* in the unziped `strating_kit_sex` directory, (e.g. open `strating_kit.Rmd` with *RStudio*).


The unziped strating-kit directory contains:

- A `data_learn.rds` file containing the data.
- A scoring program folder containing the program to compute the scoring (for you information).
- A `starting_kit.Rmd` corresponding to the vignette of the Challenge (all useful information can be found here).
- A `submission_script_sex.Rmd` to modify and to use to submit your predictions.

[3] In the R console launch the following command: 

```
rmarkdown::render("starting_kit.Rmd")
```

It i) procudes the file "starting_kit.html" that explains how to analyse data and produce results ii) generates a simple prediction for missing expression value. 
The `submission_script_sex.Rmd` script is in charge of this part. 
In the future, you will adapt this script and try a more complex predictions.

[4] Now, letâ€™s submit your prediction (zip file) in the `Participate` tab of the codalab challenge.

The metric used to evaluate prediction is the true positive rate :
$$TPR = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n{\delta(Y_i == \widehat{Y}_i )}$$
